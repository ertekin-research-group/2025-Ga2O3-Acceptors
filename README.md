# 2025-Ga2O3-Acceptors

This repository hosts the computed atomic structures and analyzed data for the study of **"Diffusion of acceptor dopants in monoclinic β-Ga₂O₃"**. It focuses on eight substitutional acceptor dopants and their diffusion behavior in the Ga₂O₃ lattice, based on first-principles calculations and climbing-image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) methods.

## Relaxed Structures of Substitutional Acceptors:
Contains atomic structures of eight substitutional acceptors (Au, Ca, Co, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, and Ni) on Ga sites in their most stable configuration, in VASP POSCAR format (`.vasp`).

## Usage

This data supports the analysis of deep-level acceptor migration and defect energetics in β-Ga₂O₃. Researchers may use the configurations and migration paths to compare migration barriers, simulate defect dynamics, or evaluate electronic effects of dopants. Data may be directly used in DFT or kinetic modeling workflows.
