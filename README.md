# 2025-Ga2O3-Acceptors

This repository hosts the computed atomic structures and analyzed data for the study of **"Diffusion of acceptor dopants in monoclinic β-Ga₂O₃"**. It focuses on eight substitutional acceptor dopants and their diffusion behavior in the Ga₂O₃ lattice, based on first-principles calculations.

## Relaxed Structures of Substitutional Acceptors:
Contains atomic structures of eight interstitial acceptors (Au, Ca, Co, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, and Ni) in their locally stable configurations, in VASP POSCAR format (`.vasp`).
