# 2025-Ga2O3-Acceptors

This repository hosts the computed atomic structures and analyzed data for the study of **"Diffusion of acceptor dopants in monoclinic β-Ga₂O₃"**. It focuses on eight substitutional acceptor dopants and their diffusion behavior in the Ga₂O₃ lattice, based on first-principles calculations and climbing-image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) methods.

## Repository Contents

### A) Relaxed Structures of Substitutional Acceptors:**
Contains atomic structures of eight substitutional acceptors (Au, Ca, Co, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, and Ni) on Ga sites in their most stable configuration, in VASP POSCAR format (`.vasp`).

### B) CI-NEB Calculations for Acceptor Diffusion
Atomic structures of CI-NEB intermediate images for selected diffusion paths of substitutional acceptors. These paths are identified as lowest-energy migration channels on the acceptors in β-Ga₂O₃.

## Usage

This data supports the analysis of deep-level acceptor migration and defect energetics in β-Ga₂O₃. Researchers may use the configurations and migration paths to compare migration barriers, simulate defect dynamics, or evaluate electronic effects of dopants. Data may be directly used in DFT or kinetic modeling workflows.
